<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>In the general case of the art gallery problem, points (guards) are placed in stationary position throughout a polygon (an art gallery). The problem is how many guards you need an where to put them to achieve full coverage of the region.</p>
<p>In this variant of the art gallery problem, we modify the power of the guard. Each guard is permitted to "patrol" an interior line segment.</p>
<p>Let s be a line segment completely contained in the polygon. Then a point p in the polygon is said to be seen by s (covered by s) if there is a point x on the line such that the segment xp is completely contained in the polygon.</p>
<p>A covering by mobile guards induces a partition into edge-visible polygons.</p>
<p>Mobile guards are more powerful than stationary guards: only three-quarters as many are needed, in both general and orthogonal polygons. Below, you can see that the the second column is 3/4 times the first. Moreover, orthogonal polygons are three-quarters easier to cover than general polygons: the second row is 3/4 times the first.</p>
