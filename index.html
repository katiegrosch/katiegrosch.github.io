<h1>Moving Guards in an Art Gallery</h1>
</div>

<div id="intro">
<p>Here I will explain the art gallery problem - that is, using a set of points whose visibility region completely covers a polygon. I will then look at the extension of using mobile guards to reduce the number necessary to cover the gallery.</p>

<h1>The Art Gallery Problem</h1>
<p>The art gallery problem is a well-studied problem in computational geometry. In the general case of the art gallery problem, points (guards) are placed in stationary position throughout a simple polygon (an art gallery). The problem is how many guards you need and where to put them to achieve full coverage of the region.</p>

<p>Below, we can see two examples: in Example 1, the art gallery is completely coverd by the guards. Every point in the art gallery can be seen. In Example 2, the art gallery is not covered. Point p is not in the visibility region of any guard.</p>

<h1>Moving Guards</h1>
<p>In this variant of the art gallery problem, we modify the power of the guard. Each guard is permitted to "patrol" an interior line segment.</p>
<p>Let s be a line segment completely contained in the polygon. Then a point p in the polygon is said to be seen by s (covered by s) if there is a point x on the line such that the segment xp is completely contained in the polygon.</p>
<p>A covering by mobile guards induces a partition into edge-visible polygons.</p>
<p>Mobile guards are more powerful than stationary guards: only three-quarters as many are needed, in both general and orthogonal polygons. Below, you can see that the the second column is 3/4 times the first. Moreover, orthogonal polygons are three-quarters easier to cover than general polygons: the second row is 3/4 times the first.</p>

<h1>Set Your Own Guards</h1>
<p>Use the application below to see what different guarding patterns would look like.</p>
<p>Click to start building a polygon, and hit the space bar when you're done. Then, build guard paths by clicking where you want the endpoints of the patrol route.</p>
