<h1>Moving Guards in an Art Gallery</h1>
</div>

<div id="intro">
<p>Here I will explain the art gallery problem - that is, using a set of points whose visibility region completely covers a polygon. I will then look at the extension of using mobile guards to reduce the number necessary to cover the gallery.</p>

<p>Much of this material comes from Joseph O'Rourke's book Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms (Oxford University Press 1987). Click <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/books/ArtGalleryTheorems/art.html">here</a> to read his full text.</p>

<h1>The Art Gallery Problem</h1>
<p>The art gallery problem is a well-studied problem in computational geometry. In the general case of the art gallery problem, points (guards) are placed in stationary position throughout a simple polygon (an art gallery). The problem is how many guards you need and where to put them to achieve full coverage of the region.</p>

<p>Below, we can see two examples: in Example 1, the art gallery is completely coverd by the guards. Every point in the art gallery can be seen. In Example 2, the art gallery is not covered. Point s is not in the visibility region of any guard.</p>

<h1>Moving Guards</h1>
<p>In this variant of the art gallery problem, we modify the power of the guard. Each guard is permitted to "patrol" an interior line segment.</p>
<p>Let s be a line segment completely contained in the polygon. Then a point p in the polygon is said to be seen by s (covered by s) if there is a point x on the line such that the segment xp is completely contained in the polygon. Below is an art gallery completely covered by two mobile guards.</p>

<p>A covering by mobile guards induces a partition into edge-visible polygons.</p>
<p>Mobile guards are more powerful than stationary guards: only three-quarters as many are needed, in both general and orthogonal polygons. Below, you can see that the the second column is 3/4 times the first. Moreover, orthogonal polygons are three-quarters easier to cover than general polygons: the second row is 3/4 times the first.</p>

<h1>Proof of the n/4 upper bound</h1>
<p>We want to show that n/4 is the upper bound for the number of mobile guards necessary to cover a polygon. First we will show that n/4 guards is necessary, and then we will prove that it is sufficient.</p>

<h4>Necessary</h4>
<p>This is actually the easy part of the proof. The picture below gives a polygon where n/4 mobile guards are necessary to cover the area.</p>

<h4>Sufficient</h4>

<p>Proving that n/4 guards suffices is an inductive proof. Basically, what we do is show that n/4 guards suffices if a guard's path can only be along a diagonal of the triangulation graph T of the polygon. Since these triangulation diagonal guards are special cases of diagonal guards, and diagonal guards are special cases of line guards, we have the n/4 bound for any moving guards.</p>

<p>First we need to establish a basic manipulation of our art gallery called an edge contraction. The contraction of an edge in the art gallery alters its triangulation graph. It takes the two endpoints of the edge we're contracting and "squashes" them together into one node.</p>

<p>Below, you can see a triangulation graph T of a polygon P. In the next three pictures, we "squash" edge e. The new triangulation, T', is the triangulation of some polygon P'.</p>

<p>Now we have the new triangulation, T'.</p>

<img src="Squashing3.png"></img>

<p>Now, suppose we place a guard on a triangulation diagonal of P so that one of his path endpoints is at an endpoint of e. Then that edge can be squashed out for guard coverage calculations. More formally, if f(n) triangulation diagonal guards are sufficient for an n-node triangulation, then a guard placed at an endpoint of an edge e means you only need f(n-1) guards to guard the rest of the polygon.</p>

<p>Next we establish that n/4 guards is sufficient for values of n between 4 and 10. With n values this small, it is easy to see that the number of possible triangulations is small, and they all guarantee that one or two guards is sufficient.</p>

<p>Finally, we establish the induction step. We must show that for any polygon P with more than 9 vertices, its triangulation graph partitions it into two pieces, one of which contains k = 5, 6, 7, or 8 arcs corresponding to edges of P.</p>

<p>To prove this, choose a diagonal of T that separates off a minimum number of polygon edges that is at least 5. The diagonal supports a triangle whose apex is between vertices 0 and k in the numbering below. Since k is minimal, t must be at least 4 and k-t must be less than or equal to 4. Adding these together, we see that k must be less than or equal to 8. So we can split off 8 vertices from the triangulation.</p>

<p>With this result, the rest of the proof is just case analysis of values of k between 5 and 8, showing that each value of k can be guarded with at most n/4 guards.</p>
